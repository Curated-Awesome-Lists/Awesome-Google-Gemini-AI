# Awesome Google Gemini AI

Gemini AI is Google‚Äôs latest LLM (large language model) that excels in power and capability compared to its predecessor. It is designed for multimodality, seamlessly reasoning across text, images, video, audio, and code. Gemini is the first model to outperform human experts on MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding), a widely-used method assessing the knowledge and problem-solving abilities of AI models. 

Gemini AI is available in three variants‚ÄîNano, Pro, and Ultra‚Äîtailored to meet diverse user needs. Nano is designed for swift on-device tasks, while Pro serves as the versatile middle tier. The Ultra variant, the most powerful among the three, is set to be released next year after undergoing safety checks.

Note: as Google Gemini AI is still in its early stages, the awesome list will be updated regularly to include new resources.
